## Hello Everyone, Rui Here! 👋


I’m an aspiring full-stack developer with a passion for learning and solving problems through technology. After several years of experience in the hospitality industry across Portugal and Spain, I decided to embrace the world of programming and turn ideas into digital solutions.


### 💻 Currently:

Developing projects that combine functionality and design.
Exploring technologies like Next.js, PostgreSQL, and API integration.
Passionate about creating platforms that make a positive impact, like Furcode, a project that helps animal shelters find homes for their furry friends.
